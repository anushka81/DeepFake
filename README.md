# Deepfake Detector Project ðŸš€

So hereâ€™s the deal: I'm trying to build a deepfake detector, but scraping a decent dataset didnâ€™t work out (accuracy sucks), and honestly, I canâ€™t even spot the fakes myself half the time ðŸ˜­. Thinking self-supervised learning might be the way to go, but it's still not finished. *If youâ€™re up for it, Iâ€™d love some help!*

### Goals
1. Get a better dataset (if you know one, drop it here!)
2. Use self-supervised learning to boost accuracy.
3. Tune this thing till it actually works.
