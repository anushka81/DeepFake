I dont have any good deepfake dataset to work on. I tried webscrapping but that didnt't work.
This app.py is based on dataset fetched from webscrapping. (bad accuracy)
I can't even tell what is deepfake and what is not just by looking at it. ðŸ˜­
According to me, this will work better with self supervised learning.
still trying.....
